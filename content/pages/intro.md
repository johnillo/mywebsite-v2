## Hello

I am a web developer at Bizwind Philippines, working in an offshore team that handles the development and maintenance of web applications of various companies in Japan. I also design, develop, test, and deploy several products and in-house systems of the company.

I specialize in web design and development and work with different web technologies - legacy and new - such as Symfony, CakePHP, Spring Boot, React, and EC-CUBE. Though I usually use industry-grade technologies for more reliable solutions, I love exploring new technologies to improve my toolkit and expand my horizon.

I enjoy my free time playing video games, coding, and trying new stuff on my ThinkPad and NUC. I also have a certified N4 level of Japanese language proficiency since 2020.
