I was trying to access a project with self-signed certificate on a Vagrant box, but Chrome doesn't allow me. There's no "Proceed to \<url\> (unsafe)" link.

### Solutions

1. Check and update the system time
2. Prevent the warning page
    - Click a blank area on the warning page
    - Type `thisisunsafe`

â€» Google changes the unlock keyword from time to time.
