## Hello

I am a software engineer at Bizwind Philippines, working in an offshore team that handles the development and maintenance of web applications of various companies in Japan. I also design, develop, test, and deploy several products and in-house systems of the company.

I specialize in web design and development, and work with different web technologies - legacy and new - such as Symfony, CakePHP, Spring Boot, React, and EC-CUBE. Though I usually use industry-grade technologies for more reliable solutions, I love exploring new technologies to improve my toolkit and expand my horizon.

In my free time, I play video games, code, and try new stuff on my personal computers. See [this page](/about/my-computing) to learn more about my computing practices.

I love Japan and I dream of living and working there someday. On 2020, I attained the N4 level of Japanese language proficiency.
