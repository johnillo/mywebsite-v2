# Hello

I'm a professional software engineer based in Makati, Philippines, specializing in web design and development. Although I use industry-grade technologies to create reliable and robust IT solutions, I love exploring new technologies to improve my toolkit and expand my horizon.

I love playing video games, coding, and trying new stuff on my personal computers in my free time. See [this page](/about/my-computing) to learn more about my computing practices.

I dream of living and working in Japan someday. In 2020, I attained the N4 level of Japanese language proficiency through self-study. However, I don't have the skills to converse in Japanese yet, but I'm currently working on it.
